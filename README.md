# Project Todos

Create a todo list in React with Redux. In the app you you can add or remove tasks and see how many completed tasks there are.

## The problem

I had a clear design in hand so it was easy both breaking down in components as well as doing the media query. 
In this project I have used React, Redux and styled components. I also used the Responsively app to get a better overview on different screen sizes.

If I had more time I would have added a drop down menu with more info about the tasks as well as the date the task was added.
